# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

The resource automatically handles:

- Cloning the source VM with specified options (when `source` is provided)
- Starting or stopping the VM based on desired state
- Cleaning up all associated files and media on destroy
- Importing existing VMs into Terraform state

## Example Usage

### Basic Clone

{{ tffile "examples/resources/vboxweb_machine/basic.tf" }}

### Clone with Power Management

{{ tffile "examples/resources/vboxweb_machine/with_state.tf" }}

### Linked Clone (Faster, Uses Less Disk)

{{ tffile "examples/resources/vboxweb_machine/linked_clone.tf" }}

### Full Clone with All Options

{{ tffile "examples/resources/vboxweb_machine/full.tf" }}

## Import

Existing VirtualBox machines can be imported into Terraform using their UUID or name.

```shell
terraform import {{.Name}}.example <machine_uuid_or_name>
```

### Import by UUID

```shell
terraform import {{.Name}}.example "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
```

### Import by Name

```shell
terraform import {{.Name}}.example "my-existing-vm"
```

~> **Note:** When importing an existing machine, the `source` attribute will be set to an empty string since the original source VM cannot be determined. For imported machines, `source` does not need to be set in your configuration since it is only used during initial creation via cloning. The `clone_mode` and `clone_options` attributes will also be set to defaults.

## Lifecycle Behavior

### Create

When `source` is specified (cloning):

1. Finds the source VM by name or UUID
2. Creates a new VM definition with the same platform architecture and OS type
3. Clones the source VM to the new VM
4. Registers the cloned VM with VirtualBox
5. Starts or stops the VM based on the `state` attribute

~> **Important:** The source VM must be powered off before cloning. VirtualBox locks the disk when a VM is running, which prevents the clone operation from accessing the source disk.

~> **Note:** Creating VMs from scratch (without a source) is not yet supported and will result in an error.

### Update

Only the `state` attribute can be updated in-place. Changes to `name`, `source`, `clone_mode`, or `clone_options` will force recreation of the resource.

### Delete

1. Powers off the VM (best-effort)
2. Unregisters the VM
3. Deletes all associated files and media using `CleanupModeFull`

## Timeouts

All long-running operations respect the `wait_timeout` attribute:

- Clone operation
- Start operation
- Stop operation
- Delete operation

The default timeout is 20 minutes. Increase this for large VMs or slow storage.
